WINDOWS NOTES
-------------

* For multichaind anti-virus software and/or firewall may need to be disabled.
* The multichaind -daemon flag does not work, so open another cmd prompt.
* The multichain-cli command line tool does not yet support interactive mode.
* The online documentation uses Linux quoting on the command line which will
  not work on DOS. Substitute (e.g.) "{\"asset1\":100}" for '{"asset1":100}'
* The default data directory is %APPDATA%\MultiChain instead of ~/.multichain

OpenSSL
-------
(Note: The OpenSSL license is not strictly compatible with GPLv3, because of
its clauses requiring acknowledgement of the OpenSSL Project. While OpenSSL is
not part of the MultiChain source code distribution, it may be statically
compiled into some binary distributions of MultiChain. Therefore, as a special
exception under section 7 of the GPLv3, Coin Sciences Ltd gives permission to
link those local portions of this program which use the OpenSSL library. You
must obey the GPLv3 in all respects for all of the code other than those local
portions of this program which use the OpenSSL library.)


  LICENSE ISSUES
  ==============

  The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of
  the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
  See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
  Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
  please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.
